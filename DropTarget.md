# Introduction #

The DropTarget is a small dialog which is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen. It allows fast and easy renaming/moving and copying of files to their target location. Just drag a file or folder onto the dialog to rename it.


# Details #

If you just drag a file onto the dialog, it will rename the file and move it to the movies folder or appropriate season folder of the series. The same happens if you press Shift when dropping the file.
If you press Alt, the file is only renamed in the location where it currently resides. It will not be moved anywhere, just renamed.
If you press Ctrl, the file is copied to the movie folder or appropriate season folder of the series with the new name. The original copy is untouched and is neither renamed nor moved.

If you drag a folder onto the dialog, all files within this folder (not-recursive!) will be renamed locally. This is helpful if you want to rename an entire series or season at once.

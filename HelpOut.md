# How can I help? #

I wrote this app for myself and found it very useful so I decided to make it open source for everyone to use and extend.

There are many ways you can help:
  * Extend media renamer with new features that are useful. Post patches in the issues tracker and if you make good contributions you can even get commit access to the SVN.
  * Help out in the group by answering questions.
  * Donate to support the development.
  * Just spread the word so people find the app and can use it.
